/**
 * The one place a `ProjectDisplayStatus` becomes a glyph — and the one place
 * the two surfaces that list projects (the rail's 最近项目 rows and the project
 * switcher above the chat) get their shared marks from, so they can never tell
 * different stories about the same project.
 *
 * A run that was interrupted is a static badge; a run still moving — or paused
 * on a question the user has to answer — is the same rotating orb in a
 * different colour, so the row reads as one object changing state rather than
 * a handful of unrelated icons. The split is "is it still going", not "did it
 * go well": spinning a stopped run's orb is the one thing this component must
 * never do, because the rotation itself is what says "working".
 *
 * Speed carries no distinction: everything that is live — queued, running
 * and awaiting a reply alike — turns at the same rate, so a colour change
 * never reads as a change of pace (P0-24: queued draws running's spinner).
 *
 * A FINISHED run is not a glyph in the lead slot at all (OPEND-3133): the row
 * keeps the folder every idle project leads with (`ProjectFolderGlyph`) and
 * says "done, unread" with a small dot at its END (`ProjectCompletionDot`),
 * which opening the project spends. `hasRunStatusGlyph` / `hasCompletionNotice`
 * are the two questions a caller asks to pick between the three.
 *
 * Returns `null` for `not_started` and `succeeded`, which draw nothing here.
 * Callers must still reserve the slot so names stay aligned; that is the
 * caller's layout concern, not this component's.

/**
 * Awaiting a reply: still live, but it is the user's move.
 *
 * A three-step warm ramp, ordered by the role each slot plays rather than by
 * hue: orange is the base, amber the second accent AND the outer bloom, gold
 * the narrow specular glint. Lightness climbs across them — OKLCH L 75.2 →
 * 83.1 → 85.0 — so the brightest slot is the one that draws the highlight,
 * which is what makes the dot read as a sphere at 14px.
 *
 * Gold in `c5` is what buys the glint back: `literal` bans the stock white
 * highlights because screen-blending white raises this accent's mid green
 * channel into yellow, but a lighter tone named outright is a colour the
 * design chose, not one the compositor invented.
 *
 * `literal` is not optional here. Without it the orb edits whatever it is
 * given — three slots still hold green, and the highlight, saturation and
 * texture passes each push a mid-channel accent off its hue. Not theoretical:
 * this palette came out green, then yellow, then red as each was found.
